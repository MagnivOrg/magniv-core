Test structure corresponds to directory structure within `magniv-core\magniv`:
- build
- core
- export
- run
- scripts
- utils

A unit test for a given method should be created under the directory that corresponds to where the original method lives in the codebase. Integration tests can be added separately if they are implemented.
